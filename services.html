    <h1>Our Services</h1>
    <p>
      Every service at Huffle’s IT Services is built to be modular, comfort-coded, and grounded in
      real-world experience backed by industry certifications (CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, CySA+,
      and related stackable certifications). As a disabled, veteran-owned business, work is planned
      around both technical best practices and realistic physical limits.
    </p>
