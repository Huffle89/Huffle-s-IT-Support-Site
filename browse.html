    <h2>How Browsing Our Services Works</h2>
    <p>
      Think of this page as a menu, not a contract. You can mix and match services,
      start small, or ask for a guided walk-through. Most people begin with one of these paths:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Safety First:</strong> Start with Firewall Setup & Support and Encryption Guidance
        if you're worried about who or what can reach your devices.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>“What if everything dies?” Mode:</strong> Choose Backup Planning plus Monitoring & Alerts
        to protect your data and get notified before small problems become big ones.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>“I need a plan when I panic” Mode:</strong> Add an Incident Response Sheet so you have
        a calm, written script for what to do when something goes wrong.
      </li>
    </ol>
