    <!-- 🔷 HOW TO USE THESE RESOURCES (NEW CONTENT) -->
    <h2>How to Use These Resources</h2>
    <p>
      This page is designed to be a calm starting point instead of an overwhelming firehose.
      You don’t have to use everything at once. Move through it in small, comfortable steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Start with safety:</strong> Read the
        <em>Home Network Security Guide</em> and pick <strong>one or two</strong> changes
        you feel okay making right now—like changing your Wi-Fi password or turning off
        unused remote access.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Layer in tools slowly:</strong> From the CISA tools list, choose a single
        tool that fits your comfort level (for example, a basic scanner or backup helper)
        instead of trying to install everything.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Use the Command Reference when you’re stuck:</strong> If a fix involves
        typing commands, keep the command reference open in a separate tab so you can
        double-check syntax without guessing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Plan your backups when you’re calm:</strong> Once the Backup Planning
        Template is available, fill it out during a low-stress moment so future-you has
        a map when things go sideways.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Build your Sanctuary over time:</strong> The Sanctuary Overlay Builder
        (coming soon) will help you design a tech space that feels emotionally safe,
        not just functional.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ask for help when needed:</strong> If any of this feels like too much,
        that’s exactly what Huffle’s is here for.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <!-- 🔷 MORE TRUSTED RESOURCES (NEW, EXPANSION ONLY) -->
    <h2>Additional Trusted IT & Security Resources</h2>
    <p>
      These external resources can help you learn more, check if your accounts have been
      exposed, and understand security news without doomscrolling.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        🔍 <strong>Have I Been Pwned:</strong> Check if your email address has appeared
        in known data breaches so you know when to change passwords or enable extra protection.
        <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank">
          Check Your Email
        </a>
      </li>

      <li>
        🔐 <strong>EFF Surveillance Self-Defense:</strong> Guides for everyday privacy,
        secure messaging, and safer browsing—especially helpful if you’re anxious about
        who can see your data.

      </li>

      <li>
        🧩 <strong>1Password, Bitwarden, and Other Password Managers:</strong> Password
        managers reduce the mental load of remembering everything while improving security.
        If you’re not sure which is right for you, we can walk through options together
        during a support session.
      </li>

      <li>
        🏠 <strong>Vendor Router Support Pages:</strong> Most home routers have online
        manuals and support articles that show where security settings live. If you know
        your router brand (Netgear, TP-Link, ASUS, etc.), bookmarking its support page
        can save a lot of stress later.
      </li>
