  <h1>About Huffle's IT Services</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <p>Founded by <span class="highlight">Christopher Lagasse</span>, Huffle's IT Services is a disabled veteran-owned IT support company built on southern grit, porch wisdom, and repeatable comfort. Every overlay, every command, and every QR code is designed to make technology feel safe, accessible, and emotionally clear.</p>

    <p>Christopher is <span class="highlight">A+</span> and <span class="highlight">Security+</span> certified, with <span class="highlight">Network+</span> and <span class="highlight">CySA+</span> in progress. His expertise spans layered security, adaptive overlays, and beginner-friendly troubleshooting that speaks plain. Whether you're a client, a student, or just passing through, this is your place.</p>

    <p>We specialize in <span class="highlight">comfort-coded overlays</span> ‚Äî modular reference systems built for clarity, inclusion, and emotional resonance. Our phased rollout strategy ensures every page is branded, protected, and scan-ready. Compatibility tags, QR logic, and filter systems help clients and students find exactly what fits their workflow.</p>

    <p>Our branding is rooted in loyalty, transparency, and southern hospitality. We use <span class="highlight">yellow, black, and earth tones</span> to signal warmth and reliability. Our logo and layouts are designed to feel familiar, not flashy ‚Äî because trust starts with comfort.</p>

    <p>Technology isn‚Äôt just about specs and scripts. It‚Äôs about making people feel <span class="highlight">safe, seen, and supported</span>. That‚Äôs why we build overlays with heart ‚Äî and why every page you visit is part of something bigger than tech.</p>
