    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p><strong>BUILT ON BACKBONE. RUN WITH HEART.</strong></p>
    <p>Welcome to Huffle’s IT Services—where tech support meets porch wisdom. I’m Christopher Lagasse, a disabled veteran and founder of this comfort-coded support company. I don’t just fix machines—I restore peace of mind. Every workflow is modular, emotionally aware, and mapped to real-world needs.</p>

    <p>Whether you’re wrangling a stubborn Wi-Fi signal, setting up a new device, or trying to get your printer to behave, I’m there with tools in hand and a calm voice on the line. My goal is simple: deliver honest, grounded tech support with the kind of loyalty you’d expect from a front porch hound.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>✯ <strong>Veteran-owned and operated</strong> — service is in my bones</li>
      <li>✯ <strong>Southern-rooted support</strong> — no jargon, just clarity</li>
      <li>✯ <strong>Wolf-coded loyalty</strong> — I stick with you 'til it’s fixed</li>
      <li>✯ <strong>Comfort-first approach</strong> — every fix mapped to emotional and sensory boundaries</li>
      <li>✯ <strong>Modular overlays</strong> — every system built with layered logic and least privilege</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your technology should feel like a trusted neighbor, not a mystery. That’s why every service I offer is backed by porch logic, practical care, and a promise: I’ll treat your tech like it’s mine.</p>
