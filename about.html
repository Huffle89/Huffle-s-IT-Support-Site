    <h1>About Huffle’s IT Services</h1>
    <p>Huffle’s IT Services LLC is a disabled veteran-owned IT Support company built on porch wisdom, southern clarity, and comfort-coded care. We don’t claim to be experts—we claim to care.</p>

    <p>Founded by Christopher Lagasse, our mission is to help real people feel safe with their technology. Whether it’s setting up a firewall, understanding encryption, or building a backup plan, we offer honest support with no shortcuts and no scare tactics.</p>

    <p>We’re certified in foundational IT security (A+ and Security+), with Network+ and CySA+ in progress. Every page, overlay, and walkthrough is designed to be emotionally clear and technically sound—so you know what’s happening and why.</p>

    <p>This site is porch-coded with care. That means every decision—from layout to language—is made with comfort, inclusion, and transparency in mind.</p>

    <p>If you’re looking for support that feels like it was built on the front porch, you’re in the right place.</p>
