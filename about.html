    <h1>About Huffleâ€™s IT Services</h1>
    <p>Huffleâ€™s IT Services LLC is a disabled veteran-owned IT support company built on porch wisdom, southern clarity, and comfort-coded care. We donâ€™t claim to be expertsâ€”we claim to care.</p>

    <p>Founded by Christopher Lagasse, our mission is to help real people feel safe with their technology. Whether itâ€™s setting up a firewall, understanding encryption, or building a backup plan, we offer honest support with no shortcuts and no scare tactics.</p>

    <p>Weâ€™re certified in foundational IT security (A+ and Security+), with Network+ and CySA+ in progress. Every page, overlay, and walkthrough is designed to be emotionally clear and technically soundâ€”so you know whatâ€™s happening and why.</p>

    <p>This site is porch-coded with care. That means every decisionâ€”from layout to languageâ€”is made with comfort, inclusion, and transparency in mind.</p>

    <p>If youâ€™re looking for support that feels like it was built on the front porch, youâ€™re in the right place.</p>
